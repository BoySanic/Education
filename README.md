# Education

3/3/2019:

I'm going to start taking free online courses to try to build my knowledge and skills. 

I've found an "open source comp sci degree" on github that's basically a list of free courses all over the internet that provide the same 
knowledge that an undergrad has when graduating with a 4-year comp sci degree, minus general education.

I'm going to take these courses and keep a log of how that goes, and nab any relevant certificates to prove I did the courses. Perhaps this'll lead somewhere and I'll be able to get myself somewhere with this.

I'm also interested in trying the "From the Transistor" thing George Hotz put out. https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor

It's basically like, starting from barebones and learning everything from the ground up.

I'll start with the open source degree first: https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs


See where this takes me.
